- **FileSizeLo** `(int)` - Filesize in bytes, Low 32-bits of 64-bit value.
- **FileSizeHi** `(int)` - Filesize in bytes, High 32-bits of 64-bit value.
- **RemainingSizeLo** `(int)` - Remaining size in bytes, Low 32-bits of 64-bit value.
- **RemainingSizeHi** `(int)` - Remaining size in bytes, High 32-bits of 64-bit value.
