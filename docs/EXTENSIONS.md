### Post processing scripts
---------------------------

After the download of nzb-file is completed nzbget can call post-processing
scripts, defined in configuration file.

Example post-processing scripts are provided in directory "scripts".

To use the scripts copy them into your local directory and set options
<ScriptDir>, <PostScript> and <ScriptOrder>.
