## About 

Feed extensions are called after an RSS feed is read and before it is processed by NZBGet.

To activate a feed script or multiple extensions put them into ScriptDir, then choose them in 
global option Extensions (FeedScript in older NZBGet versions) or per feed option FeedX.Extensions.

## Writing post-processing extensions

> Please read [Extensions](EXTENSIONS.md) for general information about extensions first!
