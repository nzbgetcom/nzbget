## About

Scheduler extensions are called by scheduler tasks (setup by the user).

## Writing scheduler extensions

> Please read [Extensions](EXTENSIONS.md) for general information about extensions first.

## Schedule

Users can activate scheduler extensions in two ways:

By creating a scheduler task with `TaskX.Command=Script` and choosing the extension. The schedule time is configured 
via scheduler task in option `TaskX.Time`.
For many scheduler extensions a reasonable default schedule can be provided by extension author, via extension definition. 
Scheduler extensions with default schedule can be activated/deactiated the Extension Manager; 
no creation of a scheduler task is required. If user doesnâ€™t like the default scheduling he can create a scheduler task 
(instead of or in addition to activating the script via option "Extensions").
