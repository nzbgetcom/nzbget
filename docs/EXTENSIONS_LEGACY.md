## Notes

>  This version of the NZBGet extensions has been deprecated and is 
not recommended for use starting with NZBGet v23.0.

> NZBGet v23.0 adds the ability to create extensions with a new approach that is more flexible and simple. 

> The Extension manager has also been added that is backward compatible 
with older extensions, but it will not be able to install or update them.
