NZBGet is a binary downloader, which downloads files from Usenet
based on information given in nzb-files. 

NZBGet is written in C++ and is known for its performance and efficiency.

NZBGet can run on almost any device - classic PC, NAS, media player, SAT-receiver, WLAN-router, etc.
The download area provides precompiled binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux. For other platforms the program can be compiled from sources.

This is a fork of the original NZBGet project formerly maintained by [hugbug](https://github.com/hugbug). The nzbget.com project is an extension of the original, and is maintained in honor of and with respect to its maintainer of many years.  We hope to continue where the [hugbug](https://github.com/hugbug) left off by providing a useful downloader for the benefit of the Usenet community.
