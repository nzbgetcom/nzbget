# Security Policy

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in NZBGet, please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues. Instead, please use GitHubs private vulnerability reporting functionality associated to this repository. 

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:
1. Type of issue
2. Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
3. Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
4. Potential impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us review your report faster.

This security policy only applies to the most recent stable branch of NZBGet. Flaws in old versions that are not present in the current stable branch will not be fixed.
